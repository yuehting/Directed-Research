Our Challenges are open-ended, allowing teams to express themselves creatively and take full ownership of their solutions. Challenges are designed to teach the creative process‚Äîa system of learning that is at the root of innovation and a child's ability to bring an idea to life.</p><p>DI Challenges take on two distinct formats: Team Challenges and Instant Challenges <br/></p><p>‚Ä¢ TEAM CHALLENGES</p><p>Each team selects one new and engaging Team Challenge requiring a solution that will be presented at the tournament. Team Challenges encourage students to explore their passions, discover their unique talents and abilities, and learn new skills. Team Challenges are available each year in the following categories: Technical, Scientific, Fine Arts, Improvisational, Engineering, Service Learning, and Early Learning. Although each Team Challenge has a specific educational focus, they each also incorporate elements to make them truly multi-disciplinary and cross-curricular (i.e., the Fine Arts Challenge will have a technical element and the Engineering Challenge will have an artistic or storytelling component.)¬†</p><p><a href=""https://www.destinationimagination.org/challenge-experience/challenge-previews/"" target=""_blank"">View our Challenge Previews</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.destinationimagination.org/challenge-experience/#elementor-action%3Aaction%3Dpopup%3Aopen%26settings%3DeyJpZCI6Ijg2OTkiLCJ0b2dnbGUiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D"" target=""_blank"">Watch a video of one team's Challenge solution</a>  <br/></p><p>‚Ä¢ INSTANT CHALLENGES</p><p>Instant Challenges are quick creative and critical-thinking exercises that build teamwork and reinforce problem-solving skills like rapid ideation and implementation.

Larger Affiliates will have two layers of competition, both Regional and Affiliate Tournaments, while others will have only one Affiliate Tournament.  <a href=""https://www.destinationimagination.org/challenge-experience/find-di-near-me/"" target=""_blank"">Contact your Affiliate ¬ª</a>  <br/></p><p> THE TOURNAMENTS</p><p>DI tournaments are where teams present their Team Challenge solutions and solve an Instant Challenge for feedback and scores.  ¬† All team members may participate in both the Team Challenge and Instant Challenge portion of the tournament. Each Team's scores from their Team Challenge and Instant Challenge are combined and then ranked against others solving the same Challenge in their level. Top placing teams are invited to the next tournament in their Affiliate or to DI's Global Finals, whichever comes next. <br/></p><p> THE CHALLENGE SEASON</p><p>Teams form and begin meeting between August and January. They typically spend 2-6 months developing their Team Challenge solutions and practicing Instant Challenges.  ¬† Each season is aligned with the Northern Hemisphere academic calendar.¬† Most local tournaments take place between February and April. For teams that qualify for Global Finals, their season may extend into May of each year. <br/></p><p><a href=""https://www.destinationimagination.org/challenge-experience/pricing/"" target=""_blank"">VIEW PRICING >></a></p><p><a href=""https://resources.destinationimagination.org/shop.php/products/product_details/143"" target=""_blank"">START A TEAM (COMING AUGUST 1, 2022) >></a></p><p><a href=""https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/kcelek/learn-about-destination-imagination"" target=""_blank"">TALK TO US >></a></p>",active,62daa2143ace1,2022-08-01 00:00:00,2023-05-24 00:00:00,,$101-$500,101,"['Pre-K', 'Elementary (K-3)', 'Elementary (4-6)', 'Middle School', 'High School', 'Post Secondary School', 'All Ages']",['Nationwide'],False,"['Boys', 'Girls', 'Students with disabilities', 'Gifted and talented students', 'Students at risk from dropping out of school']","['English', 'Chinese (Mandarin)', 'Korean', 'Spanish']",141 S Black Horse Pike,Blackwood,United States,New Jersey,08012,856-324-4787,39.798344,-75.06417,"['Architecture and Design', 'Arts', 'Biology', 'Computer Science', 'Digital Media Production', 'Earth and Environmental Science', 'Engineering', 'General Science', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Humanities', 'Making/DIY', 'Math', 'Natural History', 'Robotics', 'Space Science/Aerospace/Rocketry', 'Technology', 'Invention Education']",['Competition'],active,False,[],945bbe4d-11a4-5487-a340-f4e7d36b452e,True,2022-23-challenge-experience,62dac7ba9197d,opportunity,True,alaw@dihq.org,2022-07-22 15:56:18,2022-07-22 15:52:26,True," HOW IT WORKSThe Challenge Experience is our flagship program for pre-K, K-12, and university students.

In the past 20 years, MSC has grown into one of the city's main family attractions. MSC has created a community by focusing on learning through play with interactive exhibits, engaging science classes, and educational programs throughout the year. What began as a grass-roots effort to create an informal, interactive educational resource for the community's children has grown into a full-fledged museum facility with interesting experiences, engaging programs, and a professional staff.\xa0</p><p>We understand that children make profound meaning from direct experience, and facilitating pathways for hands-on exploratory learning for real world problem solving is the mission of the Science Center. Budding scientists, engineers and inventors can spark curiosity through interactive engagement in many ways through the Montana Science Center.\xa0</p><p>Increasingly, students need access to high-tech tools and materials in order to take their place in a fast paced, technology-driven world. MSC opened the high-tech makerspace STEAMlab in 2015, offering personally relevant project-based learning opportunities to kids ages 7 and up with the aim of bolstering interest and expertise in 21st century skills. Since it's opening, students have come to the STEAMlab to learn how to design in 3D, code robots, play collaboratively in Minecraft, complete projects with a laser cutter and more. Students discover tools in the STEAMlab that allow them to develop critical thinking, creativity and problem solving. Projects in the STEAMlab encourage students to envision themselves with skills for real world challenges. The STEAMlab is also the foundation for MSC's outreach programs with the STEAMTruck, piloted in Summer 2021, that strives to reach students and adults in rural communities by bringing high-tech materials directly to them.\xa0</p><p>With the success of the STEAMlab, Montana Science Center's board of directors participated in a ‚Äúrevisioning‚Äù process in 2017 that allowed them to reconnect with the most frequent visitors, past board members and community members to address a declining visitation in the overall museum, but increasing visitation in the STEAMlab. Through this revisioning process, the Children's Museum of Bozeman recognized it's full potential as the Montana Science Center. Still a place for play and imagination, but one focused on the values of the community - enhanced engagement and learning in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics.\xa0</p><p>In January of 2020, families were welcomed into a new location nearly double the size of the previous location. In this new location, families are able to discover new topics of science like Dangerous Nature, the universe, building and engineering. With a frequently rotating collection of interactive exhibits, families with children of all ages can explore together in order to spark curiosity and learn through play. The exhibit floor also hosts a Science Station featuring activities and experiments to take learning further. It frequently features ‚Äúlong term‚Äù experiments such as bacteria cultures, live plants, mushroom habitats and worm composting to engage families over a series of visits. Each of these activities aims to engage families in meaningful discussions of STEM topics over an activity.\xa0</p><p>In addition to the numerous place-based activities and opportunities, MSC grew into various virtual avenues during the COVID pandemic in 2020. During a nearly 6-month closure, MSC staff worked tirelessly to reach families at a time when they needed interaction the most. From this stressful time came several online video series such as 30 Seconds in STEM featuring local STEM professionals and Science at Home, a science cooking series led by youth. Additionally, MSC began reaching families in their home with Science at Home STEAMkits. MSC was able to learn many techniques to encourage at-home learning in STEAM during difficult times when formal schooling was unpredictable.\xa0</p><p>In uncertain times, families have been able to rely on Montana Science Center for quality, engaging opportunities in STEM topics regardless of their ability to pay or mode of delivery. The 2020 COVID pandemic taught science centers all over the country that they could create sustainable programs in a pivoting world. Montana Science Center is no different. As the organization launches into its 20th year in 2021, enhanced science education through play is the foundation of creating opportunities for students to discover STEM careers and learn to understand the world around them.<br/></p>"", 'logo': '/content/images/6142255428046-image.jpeg', 'collaborative': [], 'collaborativeId': [], 'isUSNational': True, 'contactFirstName': 'Emma', 'contactLastName': 'Papasian', 'contactTitle': 'Program Assistant', 'contactEmail': 'epapasian@montanasciencecenter.org', 'locationStreet': '2744 W Main St', 'locationCity': 'Bozeman', 'locationState': 'Montana', 'locationCountry': 'United States', 'locationPostalCode': 59718, 'locationPhone': '406-522-9087', 'locationLatitude': 45.6721848, 'locationLongitude': -111.0742002, 'socialMediaFacebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/MontanaScienceCenter/', 'socialMediaTwitter': 'https://twitter.com/MTScienceCenter', 'socialMediaLinkedIn': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/montanasciencecenter/', 'socialMediaYoutube': 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkk9QGwM3hbW16nbNhNtVAw', 'socialMediaInstagram': 'https://www.instagram.com/montanasciencecenter/', 'year': 2001, 'website': 'https://montanasciencecenter.org/', 'affiliation': [], 'focus': ['Technology', 'Invention Education', 'Coding/Programming', 'Arts', 'Math', 'General Science', 'Architecture and Design', 'Earth and Environmental Science', 'Making/DIY', 'Robotics', 'Space Science/Aerospace/Rocketry', 'Computer Science', 'Biology', 'Engineering'], 'isLedByNonProfitOrganization': True, 'neededResources': [], 'availableResources': [], 'collaborationInterests': [], 'populationServed': [], 'youthServed': 8000, 'serviceDeliveryFormat': [], 'currentEvaluationProcess': [], 'isVMLinked': False, 'isVMActionRequired': False, 'isOnlineOnly': False, 'isCertified': False, 'slug': 'montana-science-center', 'id': '6142255474466', 'type': 'program', 'status': 'active', 'isUserContactInfo': True, 'author': 'MSCBozeman', 'updated': '2021-11-12 16:20:39', 'created': '2021-09-15 16:54:44', 'publishedInConnectory': True, 'excerpt': 'Our mission is to provide hands-on learning experiences in science and technology that inspire creativity, innovation, and lead to real-world applicat...', 'opportunitiesFound': 5}"

In club they can build on their own skill sets in S.T.E.M., critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving.¬†</p><div><br/></div><div>¬†STEM careers are the highest growing fields and have the most potential for increased income, workforce projections show that nine of the 10 fastest-growing occupations that require at least a bachelor's degree will require significant scientific or mathematical training.¬†STEM academics and workforce has traditionally been a male-dominated area. In 2018, the US Department of Labor identified that women in STEM-related occupations only account for 26% of the workforce. Within that 26% of women only make up 16% of engineers, 25% of computer and technology, 48% in mathematics, and 45% in physical sciences.

88,"Air Camp, Inc.","<p>  During school breaks, this project offers three camps where middle-school students apply STEM theories in real life, soaring through a curriculum aligned with national guidelines. Ten certified STEM fellows, including six PhD/EdD educators, developed the innovative content, which includes an aircraft flight data recorder ‚Äúblack box‚Äù water recovery mission on Sunday, and fifteen jam packed contact hours per day Monday-Thursday. Friday commences with a surprise international rescue mission and ends with a graduation celebration. <br/></p><p>Using a university campus as a ‚Äúhub,‚Äù Air Camp participants travel out the ‚Äúspokes‚Äù to the Dayton aviation and aeronautical activity sites. At the National Museum of the United States Air Force, students receive instruction in the physics of flight. They also learn the history of aviation pioneers like the Wright Brothers and Hans von Ohain, test aerodynamic shapes in wind tunnels, understand the lift and drag equations, and learn the principles of jet propulsion. Students investigate aircraft and aerospace vehicle structural design, study flight instrumentation, and electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic subsystems.</p><p>Later, students visit Dayton International Airport to experience the choreography of coordinating a commercial air carrier flight from Dayton to Chicago from the viewpoint of pilots, air traffic controllers, and personnel managing a major air terminal and airfield complex. At Dayton‚Äôs K12 Gallery, students design and apply air vehicle exterior paint schemes‚Äîadding art as part of a science, technology, engineering, arts, and technology (STEAM) experience. Next, students visit an airport Fire Fighting and Rescue Facility, where they learn the thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, chemistry, and physics of fire suppression and aircrew/passenger rescue and recovery. They don firefighter‚Äôs personal protection equipment and breathing systems, handle a fire hose at full flow rate, and serve as subjects for emergency medical treatment using state-of-the-art paramedic equipment. At Sinclair Community College, students immerse themselves in mission flight planning instruction, and receive training on elaborate desktop and full motion flight simulators. Later, the Air Camp class receives instruction in, and operates unmanned aerial vehicles, followed immediately by a visit to a commercial UAV development and production facility at the Springfield-Beckley Airport. As a capstone experience, the students fly a general aviation aircraft from the left (pilot-in-command‚Äôs) seat, with an FAA-certified instructor pilot, on a mission that the student personally flight planned the day prior. <br/></p><p>As a final graduation exercise, using the information they have accumulated over the Air Camp week, students plan and present in a formal mission briefing scenario, an international rescue mission. They select the aircraft to be used, specify the communications, navigation and senor system to be employed, plan the route of flight, calculating the time, distance, effect of winds, and fuel required for mission accomplishment. The exercise is structured as a competition among the 11-member student teams, in which they bring to bear the principles of aviation and aeronautics, air vehicle design and capability, flight mission planning, and aviation logistics learned throughout the week. ¬†  The teams‚Äô mission plans are evaluated and scored by a panel of pilots, engineers, and aircraft acquisition managers. ¬†  The top scoring team is honored at the Air Camp graduation ceremony that afternoon. ¬†    <br/></p>",active,56ecada869de2,,,,"$501-$1,000",501,['Middle School'],,,,,Wright State University,Fairborn,United States,Ohio,45435,937-304-5264,39.781483,-84.06358,"['Space Science/Aerospace/Rocketry', 'Technology', 'Engineering']",['Summer'],active,False,,513f09a4-4a61-5fdc-8aef-79e9b85a860e,True,air-camp-inc,56ecb1be1da8e,opportunity,False,Aircamp,2021-11-23 22:55:20,2016-03-19 01:56:14,True,"  During school breaks, this project offers three camps where middle-school students apply STEM theories in real life, soaring through a curriculum al...",,,,,,,,,"{'title': 'Air Camp, Inc.', 'description': '<p>  </p><p>      Air Camp is a hands-on, educational adventure in aviation and aeronautics  .

113,Brook Trout Pond Survey Project,"<p>This three team program (Trout Unlimited, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and Maine Audubon) was created to identify previously-undocumented wild brook trout populations in remote Maine ponds. Maine brook trout are a special resource, and the teams need to know where they are before the species can be protected and management offered to them appropriately. The information collected by volunteer anglers will help inform future fisheries management decisions. The success of this project is entirely dependent on the data collected by volunteer anglers. Anglers can choose one or more ponds in a survey area to find and fish. The project's focus on remote ponds offers angler a chance to explore new places while advancing trout conservation efforts. This project seeks to concentrate survey efforts on those ponds that are most likely to contain wild populations of brook trout. None of these ponds have ever been surveyed by Maine fisheries biologists, and there are no records of past stocking, so any brook trout found in them are native, wild fish.</p><p>Learn more at <a href=""http://www.tumaine.org/brooktrout.htm"" target=""_blank"">http://www.tumaine.org/brooktrout.htm</a>.</p>",active,57bba84e701e6,,,Eastern Standard Time,Free,0,"['Middle School', 'High School']",,,,['English'],20 Gilsland Farm Road,Falmouth,United States,Maine,04469,,43.705917,-70.24045,"['Biology', 'General Science']",['Citizen Science'],active,False,,d8f35d48-7585-54c5-86b7-78c3faa3f297,True,brook-trout-pond-survey-project,57be3fae1131b,opportunity,False,ccaverly,2021-11-23 22:54:53,2016-08-25 00:45:34,True,"This three team program (Trout Unlimited, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and Maine Audubon) was created to identify previously-undo...",,The Connectory,,,,,,,"{'title': 'Maine Audubon', 'description': '<p>Our mission: Maine Audubon works to conserve Maine\'s wildlife and wildlife habitat by engaging people of all ages in education, conservation and action.

Caf√©s promote exploration, curiosity, and life-long learning about current and cutting-edge ideas in science and technology.\xa0\xa0</p><p>The Caf√© model is flexible, and continuously builds upon best practices. Caf√©s are planned and led by teen leaders with the support of an adult leader. The events typically take place once per month during the school calendar year for 1.5 hours per event. Caf√©s may begin with a short socializing period including a welcoming table staffed by teen leaders, refreshments, maybe background music, and a fun icebreaker. The caf√© focus then shifts to the scientist or engineer, who begins with a lively introduction to some hot science topic to launch conversation among the teens. She or he may also share story-like anecdotes to show the personal side of finding one's career path. The science conversation piece is often\xa0followed by an activity to further explore the topic.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>What is the Teen Science Caf√© Network?</p><p>The Teen Science Caf√© Network is a nation-wide web of organizations that host caf√©s. Our Network Resource Center is funded by an NSF grant to grow and support organizations starting and continuing their own Teen Science Caf√©s. Network members support each other by sharing resources and expertise regarding Caf√©s including models for mentoring teens to take ownership of <i>their</i>\xa0program, and methods of vetting and preparing scientists and engineers to interact effectively with a teenage audience.\xa0</p><p><i> The caf√© model can be freely adopted within the framework of the program's Core Design Principles, Network membership is free, and we offer a small grant for new sites.\xa0 </i><br/></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p>Impact.\xa0</p><p>Our evaluations have demonstrated that Teen Science Caf√© programs significantly increase teens' understanding of the nature of STEM (science, tech, engineering and math). They develop a realistic and positive perception of scientists and engineers and the lives they lead, learning that they are real, complex, multidimensional humans, like them. They get a glimpse of the interesting lives in STEM fields that the presenters lead. They become aware of the relevance of science and technology in their own lives. They may become aware of the possibility of a life in science for themselves. Along the way, teen organizers gain a host of leadership skills as they plan, market, host, and evaluate <i>their </i>caf√©s.</p><p><br/></p><p>How do I\xa0become a member of the Teen Science Caf√© Network?</p><p>We encourage any organization that wishes to form a Teen Science Caf√© to contact us for more info, and request membership  in the network via Get Started links on TeenScienceCafe.org. \xa0Membership is free, and you will be warmly welcomed and strongly supported. \xa0Our Guide to Starting a Teen Science Caf√©  can be found in the  Resources \xa0section of this website. \xa0Members can also gain and share best practices\xa0via our  blog, our annual in-person Members' Workshop,\xa0and our regular teleconferences and webinars. http://teensciencecafe.org</p><p></p>"", 'logo': '/content/images/577bf74a6a316-image.jpeg', 'isUSNational': False, 'contactFirstName': 'Michelle', 'contactLastName': 'Hall', 'contactTitle': 'Co-Director, Teen Science Caf√ï¬© Network', 'contactEmail': 'info@teensciencecafe.org', 'locationStreet': '4200 E Jemez Rd', 'locationAdditional': 'Suite 301', 'locationCity': 'Los Alamos', 'locationState': 'New Mexico', 'locationCountry': 'United States', 'locationPostalCode': 87544, 'locationPhone': '505-412-6533', 'locationLatitude': 35.8784787, 'locationLongitude': -106.3187614, 'socialMediaFacebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/teenscicafe', 'socialMediaTwitter': 'https://twitter.com/TeenScienceCafe', 'socialMediaLinkedIn': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-hall-b6b4b15?trk=hp-identity-name', 'socialMediaYoutube': 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRi9XKXbA5IW91saExrjHlQ', 'year': 2012, 'website': 'http://teensciencecafe.org', 'focus': ['Arts', 'Biology', 'Coding/Programming', 'Computer Science', 'Earth and Environmental Science', 'Engineering', 'General Science', 'Invention Education', 'Math', 'Natural History', 'Space Science/Aerospace/Rocketry', 'Technology', 'Robotics'], 'youthServed': 180000, 'isVMLinked': False, 'isVMActionRequired': False, 'isOnlineOnly': False, 'VMTimestamp': '2016-07-05T18:09:00Z', 'isCertified': False, 'slug': 'teen-science-cafe-network', 'id': '577bf74a9ee24', 'type': 'program', 'status': 'active', 'isUserContactInfo': True, 'author': 'teensciencecafe', 'updated': '2018-03-14 13:10:32', 'created': '2016-07-05 18:07:06', 'publishedInConnectory': True, 'excerpt': ' \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0...', 'opportunitiesFound': 4}"

Caf√©s promote exploration, curiosity, and life-long learning about current and cutting-edge ideas in science and technology.\xa0\xa0</p><p>The Caf√© model is flexible, and continuously builds upon best practices. Caf√©s are planned and led by teen leaders with the support of an adult leader. The events typically take place once per month during the school calendar year for 1.5 hours per event. Caf√©s may begin with a short socializing period including a welcoming table staffed by teen leaders, refreshments, maybe background music, and a fun icebreaker. The caf√© focus then shifts to the scientist or engineer, who begins with a lively introduction to some hot science topic to launch conversation among the teens. She or he may also share story-like anecdotes to show the personal side of finding one's career path. The science conversation piece is often\xa0followed by an activity to further explore the topic.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>What is the Teen Science Caf√© Network?</p><p>The Teen Science Caf√© Network is a nation-wide web of organizations that host caf√©s. Our Network Resource Center is funded by an NSF grant to grow and support organizations starting and continuing their own Teen Science Caf√©s. Network members support each other by sharing resources and expertise regarding Caf√©s including models for mentoring teens to take ownership of <i>their</i>\xa0program, and methods of vetting and preparing scientists and engineers to interact effectively with a teenage audience.\xa0</p><p><i> The caf√© model can be freely adopted within the framework of the program's Core Design Principles, Network membership is free, and we offer a small grant for new sites.\xa0 </i><br/></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p>Impact.\xa0</p><p>Our evaluations have demonstrated that Teen Science Caf√© programs significantly increase teens' understanding of the nature of STEM (science, tech, engineering and math). They develop a realistic and positive perception of scientists and engineers and the lives they lead, learning that they are real, complex, multidimensional humans, like them.

Change the geometry from orthogonal to diagonal and transform quarter, half and three-quarter rounds into fans, tall cones, and circular pavilions. Look for patterns in nature to find geometric forms and design with paper across scales. Capture nature's verbs and transform their gesture into spatial configurations. Make progressive folds, add thrust and lift to fly planes of different technical abilities. In the final folding magic, use linear and diagonal geometries shifted through translational symmetrical folding and complete binary bug lamps!

Connecting young people to the very places that they live and learn through the mind of the architect, designer, scientist, and engineer, NEXT.cc looks at how culture, society, technology, and the environment shape design responses. <br/></p><p>MISSION <br/></p><p>* Nurture Imagination <br/></p><p>* Develop Relational Understandings of the Built and Natural World <br/></p><p>* Promote Stewardship of the Environment <br/></p><p>* Enable eco-literacy and digital-fluency through place-based design projects <br/></p><p>* Connect Classrooms with Improving the World <br/></p><p> Its  STEAM by DESIGN  approach connects art, architecture, engineering, and construction as dynamic creative processes and drivers of 21 st century innovation. Accessing architecture through tools,  languages,  discovery, and design journeys aligned to  NGSS,  Art/Design, and  NAEEA standards, participants draw, paint, write, sketch, animate, model online inside and become architectural investigators outside.  Participants research relationships between objects, people, and space and construct ideas as they link with virtual field trips, global institutions, museum collections, and global art, design, and architecture careers. Students analyze sites, research conditions, develop concepts, experience the iterative design process and enjoy methods of making. Empowered to collaborate, create and communicate, students engage in their communities as active participants, place makers and urban stewards of the built and natural environment. <br/></p><p><span id=""selectionBoundary_1521469258176_8104200448264386"" class=""rangySelectionBoundary"">\ufeff</span><span id=""selectionBoundary_1521469252234_6226681330083746"" class=""rangySelectionBoundary"">\ufeff</span><span id=""selectionBoundary_1521469229030_5856650893756392"" class=""rangySelectionBoundary""><span id=""selectionBoundary_1521469287984_4979352178783075"" class=""rangySelectionBoundary"">\ufeff</span></span><span id=""selectionBoundary_1521469263078_14792511490881977"" class=""rangySelectionBoundary""></span>Founded <span id=""selectionBoundary_1521469282296_06975390174262242"" class=""rangySelectionBoundary"">\ufeff</span>as an education nonprofit in 2007 that offers free curricular resources to students and teachers introducing what design is, what it does <span id=""selectionBoundary_1521469292594_2886294486908665"" class=""rangySelectionBoundary"">\ufeff</span>and why it is important to our sustainable future, NEXT.cc is a collaborative effort by principals, teachers, architects, <span id=""selectionBoundary_1521469305422_8643717797397014"" class=""rangySelectionBoundary"">\ufeff</span>artists and college art, art education, design, and architecture students.

At Code Ninjas we use a martial arts theme to guide kids through our coding curriculum where they begin as a white belt and progress to a black belt. As a white belt, ninjas (kids) use the Scratch program and our state of the art Game Development Platform to begin building a coding foundation. Scratch is a drag and drop block system that easily teaches ninjas the building blocks of coding. As they move forward to higher belts, ninjas begin using JavaScript to write code, eventually moving to the black belt where they use C #. At the black belt level Ninjas are able to create a game or an app for the APP Store.¬†</p><p>Our program teaches Ninjas collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving skills, while providing them with the necessary skills needed in our technically advanced culture. Our drop-in program is offered Monday through Friday from 3 pm to 7 pm and Saturdays from 10 am to 2 pm. Ninjas attend for 2 hours per week¬† to work on our curriculum with the help with our amazing staff of Sensei's who guide them through their journey to the black belt. After spending at least 30 minutes on the curriculum Ninjas are provided with a wide assortment of stem activities that use the scratch program, so our ninjas¬†get instant gratification seeing their new found coding skills at work.¬†</p>",active,5cdb2721a9d99,,,Mountain Standard Time,$101-$500,101,"['Elementary (4-6)', 'Middle School', 'High School']",,False,"['Boys', 'Girls', 'Students with disabilities', 'Gifted and talented students']",['English'],1387 E South Boulder Rd,Louisville,United States,Colorado,80027,720-379-7638,39.987194,-105.123505,"['Coding/Programming', 'Computer Science', 'Engineering', 'Technology', 'Robotics', 'Math', 'Invention Education']",['Visit/Drop-In'],active,False,,472ef308-2197-5491-99c9-1e360c451d8f,True,drop-in-program,5cdf3272722c1,opportunity,False,cnlouisville,2021-11-23 22:53:10,2019-05-17 22:15:14,True,Our first of its kind¬†ÔªøÔªødrop-in program givesÔªøÔªø¬†Ôªø¬†Ôªøkids ages 7-14 the excitingÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªø¬†opÔªøportuÔªønityÔªøÔªøÔªø...,,,Units E & F,,,,,,"{'title': 'Code Ninjas Louisville', 'description': '<p>Code Ninjas is a brand new coding center in Louisville for kids ages 7 - 14.</p><p><span id=""selectionBoundary_1558352839240_8726783435927331"" class=""rangySelectionBoundary"">\ufeff</span>Code Ninjas Louisville is a forward thinking community that believes coding is the language of the future.\xa0We\xa0provide kids with the tools needed to thrive in our technology driven world.

The program organizes college volunteers to bring science presentations filled with fun experiments and empowering dialogue to elementary school classrooms. In just three years, Boundless Brilliance has reached over 7,000 elementary students. Partnering with 21 local elementary schools, Boundless Brilliance has now given over 250 free presentations with the help of over 100 volunteers. During the pandemic, Boundless Brilliance is providing a wide array of virtual programming options.\xa0</p><p>Boundless Brilliance was founded in 2017 by three female undergraduate students majoring in STEM  at Occidental College after reading a study in Science Magazine which concluded that by age six, girls identify intelligence as a predominantly male trait. The founders were shocked by this finding and knew they needed to take immediate action. As women pursuing degrees in biochemistry, mathematics, and environmental biology, they recognized on a daily basis the tendency for their female peers to avoid raising their hands during lectures and to minimize their successes in the lab and workplace; along with the fact that males made up the vast majority of the students in their classes.

277,INTRO TO ARDUINO KIT,"<p>  Start your journey into programming with the most popular open-source prototyping platform in the world. While the platform originally developed for beginners with very little to no background in electronics and programming, Arduino is now used by everyone from hobbyists to professional engineers. With Arduino you can design your own custom circuits and then program them to do just about anything you want! Through this exciting hands-on kit you will learn the fundamentals of coding in Arduino, including how to blink an LED, use pulse width modulation (PWM) to mimic analog outputs, read a sensor, use serial commutation to send custom commands to the Arduino microprocessor vis USB, implement control structures, produce tones, and much more!  Note: Normally we require learners to follow the provided level progression, however, those who are more interested in learning programming may choose to begin their Techsplorers Project Kit journey in the Programming track with this Level 3 course (in which case the Starter Kit materials should be selected at checkout). You can always go back and start at the beginning later, but we must warn you, the better you understand hardware, the better equipped you will be to understand and make improvements to your Arduino projects.¬†</p><p>Learn more:¬†<a href=""http://techsplorers.com/kits/arduino.html"" target=""_blank"">http://techsplorers.com/kits/arduino.html</a><br/></p>",active,87971,,,,$51-$100,51,"['Elementary (4-6)', 'Middle School', 'High School', 'Post Secondary School']",['Nationwide'],False,"['Boys', 'Girls', 'Gifted and talented students']",['English'],14460 Falls of Neuse Rd,Raleigh,United States,North Carolina,27614,,35.94373,-78.54393,"['Coding/Programming', 'Computer Science', 'Engineering', 'Invention Education', 'Technology', 'Robotics', 'Making/DIY']",['Online: On Your Own'],active,False,,9d53b005-75d1-59c3-a1b2-0574451a8c8b,True,intro-to-arduino-kit,5f0910d5bfa56,opportunity,False,techsplorers,2021-11-23 22:52:30,2020-07-11 01:07:33,True,  Start your journey into programming with the most popular open-source prototyping platform in the world.
