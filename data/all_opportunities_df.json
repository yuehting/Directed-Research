None of these ponds have ever been surveyed by Maine fisheries biologists, and there are no records of past stocking, so any brook trout found in them are native, wild fish.<\/p><p>Learn more at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tumaine.org\/brooktrout.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.tumaine.org\/brooktrout.htm<\/a>.<\/p>","114":"<p>Citizen scientists are needed to help watch for wildlife on the road!<\/p><p>Maine Audubon seeks road watch volunteers.<\/p><p>As the weather warms up, many animals are on the move and are more  likely to be spotted on or near Maine roads.

At Code Ninjas we use a martial arts theme to guide kids through our coding curriculum where they begin as a white belt and progress to a black belt. As a white belt, ninjas (kids) use the Scratch program and our state of the art Game Development Platform to begin building a coding foundation. Scratch is a drag and drop block system that easily teaches ninjas the building blocks of coding. As they move forward to higher belts, ninjas begin using JavaScript to write code, eventually moving to the black belt where they use C #. At the black belt level Ninjas are able to create a game or an app for the APP Store.\u00a0<\/p><p>Our program teaches Ninjas collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving skills, while providing them with the necessary skills needed in our technically advanced culture. Our drop-in program is offered Monday through Friday from 3 pm to 7 pm and Saturdays from 10 am to 2 pm. Ninjas attend for 2 hours per week\u00a0 to work on our curriculum with the help with our amazing staff of Sensei's who guide them through their journey to the black belt. After spending at least 30 minutes on the curriculum Ninjas are provided with a wide assortment of stem activities that use the scratch program, so our ninjas\u00a0get instant gratification seeing their new found coding skills at work.\u00a0<\/p>","228":"<p>  The Maine Maritime Academy's Discovery Voyage is an on-campus day program where high school and middle school students apply their math and science knowledge aboard oceanographic research vessels, in engineering operations labs, and high tech maritime simulation.

In the past 20 years, MSC has grown into one of the city's main family attractions. MSC has created a community by focusing on learning through play with interactive exhibits, engaging science classes, and educational programs throughout the year. What began as a grass-roots effort to create an informal, interactive educational resource for the community's children has grown into a full-fledged museum facility with interesting experiences, engaging programs, and a professional staff.\u00a0<\/p><p>We understand that children make profound meaning from direct experience, and facilitating pathways for hands-on exploratory learning for real world problem solving is the mission of the Science Center. Budding scientists, engineers and inventors can spark curiosity through interactive engagement in many ways through the Montana Science Center.\u00a0<\/p><p>Increasingly, students need access to high-tech tools and materials in order to take their place in a fast paced, technology-driven world. MSC opened the high-tech makerspace STEAMlab in 2015, offering personally relevant project-based learning opportunities to kids ages 7 and up with the aim of bolstering interest and expertise in 21st century skills. Since it's opening, students have come to the STEAMlab to learn how to design in 3D, code robots, play collaboratively in Minecraft, complete projects with a laser cutter and more. Students discover tools in the STEAMlab that allow them to develop critical thinking, creativity and problem solving. Projects in the STEAMlab encourage students to envision themselves with skills for real world challenges. The STEAMlab is also the foundation for MSC's outreach programs with the STEAMTruck, piloted in Summer 2021, that strives to reach students and adults in rural communities by bringing high-tech materials directly to them.\u00a0<\/p><p>With the success of the STEAMlab, Montana Science Center's board of directors participated in a \u201crevisioning\u201d process in 2017 that allowed them to reconnect with the most frequent visitors, past board members and community members to address a declining visitation in the overall museum, but increasing visitation in the STEAMlab. Through this revisioning process, the Children's Museum of Bozeman recognized it's full potential as the Montana Science Center. Still a place for play and imagination, but one focused on the values of the community - enhanced engagement and learning in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics.\u00a0<\/p><p>In January of 2020, families were welcomed into a new location nearly double the size of the previous location. In this new location, families are able to discover new topics of science like Dangerous Nature, the universe, building and engineering. With a frequently rotating collection of interactive exhibits, families with children of all ages can explore together in order to spark curiosity and learn through play. The exhibit floor also hosts a Science Station featuring activities and experiments to take learning further. It frequently features \u201clong term\u201d experiments such as bacteria cultures, live plants, mushroom habitats and worm composting to engage families over a series of visits. Each of these activities aims to engage families in meaningful discussions of STEM topics over an activity.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition to the numerous place-based activities and opportunities, MSC grew into various virtual avenues during the COVID pandemic in 2020. During a nearly 6-month closure, MSC staff worked tirelessly to reach families at a time when they needed interaction the most. From this stressful time came several online video series such as 30 Seconds in STEM featuring local STEM professionals and Science at Home, a science cooking series led by youth. Additionally, MSC began reaching families in their home with Science at Home STEAMkits. MSC was able to learn many techniques to encourage at-home learning in STEAM during difficult times when formal schooling was unpredictable.\u00a0<\/p><p>In uncertain times, families have been able to rely on Montana Science Center for quality, engaging opportunities in STEM topics regardless of their ability to pay or mode of delivery. The 2020 COVID pandemic taught science centers all over the country that they could create sustainable programs in a pivoting world. Montana Science Center is no different. As the organization launches into its 20th year in 2021, enhanced science education through play is the foundation of creating opportunities for students to discover STEM careers and learn to understand the world around them.<br\/><\/p>","logo":"\/content\/images\/6142255428046-image.jpeg","collaborative":[],"collaborativeId":[],"isUSNational":true,"contactFirstName":"Emma","contactLastName":"Papasian","contactTitle":"Program Assistant","contactEmail":"epapasian@montanasciencecenter.org","locationStreet":"2744 W Main St","locationCity":"Bozeman","locationState":"Montana","locationCountry":"United States","locationPostalCode":59718,"locationPhone":"406-522-9087","locationLatitude":45.6721848,"locationLongitude":-111.0742002,"socialMediaFacebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MontanaScienceCenter\/","socialMediaTwitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MTScienceCenter","socialMediaLinkedIn":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/montanasciencecenter\/","socialMediaYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCkk9QGwM3hbW16nbNhNtVAw","socialMediaInstagram":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/montanasciencecenter\/","year":2001,"website":"https:\/\/montanasciencecenter.org\/","affiliation":[],"focus":["Technology","Invention Education","Coding\/Programming","Arts","Math","General Science","Architecture and Design","Earth and Environmental Science","Making\/DIY","Robotics","Space Science\/Aerospace\/Rocketry","Computer Science","Biology","Engineering"],"isLedByNonProfitOrganization":true,"neededResources":[],"availableResources":[],"collaborationInterests":[],"populationServed":[],"youthServed":8000,"serviceDeliveryFormat":[],"currentEvaluationProcess":[],"isVMLinked":false,"isVMActionRequired":false,"isOnlineOnly":false,"isCertified":false,"slug":"montana-science-center","id":"6142255474466","type":"program","status":"active","isUserContactInfo":true,"author":"MSCBozeman","updated":"2021-11-12 16:20:39","created":"2021-09-15 16:54:44","publishedInConnectory":true,"excerpt":"Our mission is to provide hands-on learning experiences in science and technology that inspire creativity, innovation, and lead to real-world applicat...","opportunitiesFound":5},"61":{"title":"Kokomo Howard County Public Library","description":"<p>Explore your OPPORTUNITIES<\/p><p>  The library serves 8 townships in Howard County including Center,  Taylor, Howard, Clay, Ervin, Harrison, Honey Creek, and Monroe.

The VLMP trains, certifies and provides technical support to hundreds of volunteers who monitor a wide range of indicators of water quality, assess watershed health and function, and screen lakes for invasive aquatic plants and animals. In addition to being the primary source of lake data in the State of Maine, VLMP volunteers benefit their local lakes by playing key stewardship and leadership roles in their communities.<\/p><p>Volunteers first must attend a training session to become certified to collect data. Volunteers must also be able to commit to collecting and transmitting data regularly throughout the season, from May through September.

Creative Problem Solving is a skill that needs to be nurtured and developed.

There is creativity inside each of us and OM teaches how to tap into it so it can be applied to real-world problems.\u00a0<\/p><p>From the start, OM recognized the importance of many of the skills now emphasized in education today such as Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math.

The program organizes college volunteers to bring science presentations filled with fun experiments and empowering dialogue to elementary school classrooms. In just three years, Boundless Brilliance has reached over 7,000 elementary students. Partnering with 21 local elementary schools, Boundless Brilliance has now given over 250 free presentations with the help of over 100 volunteers. During the pandemic, Boundless Brilliance is providing a wide array of virtual programming options.\u00a0<\/p><p>Boundless Brilliance was founded in 2017 by three female undergraduate students majoring in STEM  at Occidental College after reading a study in Science Magazine which concluded that by age six, girls identify intelligence as a predominantly male trait. The founders were shocked by this finding and knew they needed to take immediate action.
